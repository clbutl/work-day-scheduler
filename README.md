# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This week's challenge was about creating a work day scheduler that actively tracks the time, while allowing you to save anything you put in it for later.

# Challenges

I had a few challenges while going through this challenge, these include using Bootstrap and using the wrong tag for inputs.

## Using Bootstrap

Since this was my first real activity actively using Bootstrap for a majority of my CSS, there were some challenges. I had some issues with styling and grouping items together, along with having trouble seperating certain elements. However, Bootstrap was a major help and saved me a lot of time throughout the whole challenge regardless.

This is an example of the visual Bootstrap grouping that I was doing.

## Using the wrong tag for the input text sections

My biggest issue was a very simple one at face value. After I had all the local storage inputs working correctly all that I needed to do was display the text on the page whenever the user reloads, but it wasn't working for the main element where it needed to work. After an hour or so of trying things out I figured out that I was using an '<input> tag' instead of an '<textarea> tag'. This ended up fixing everything and after completing this the rest was pretty straightforward. 

# Conclusion

All in all this challenge really helped me with my personal confidence. I understood what was required to complete this challenge and I believe I did everything relatively well. Overall I'm very happy with how I completed everything and I'm happy I did it the way I did.
